These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. I'm currently using Python 3.

```
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
python main.py  # to execute
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
